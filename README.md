In this repository, I create Python notebooks to do the followign two things:
1. Demonstrate the connection to Microsoft SQL Server (2017 version) using the Python ODBC interface and the Pyodbc module.
2. Conduct data preprossessing on the famous sample SQL database, Northwind. The SQL programming skills I covered would be in order from introductory to advanced level.
